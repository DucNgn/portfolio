                <p>
                  That was my very first "Hello, world" program I wrote, all the way back when I was in primary school and learning Pascal. 
                  It was intimidating for a 9 years old boy to write something and make it work on a black and white computer screen, but it ignited my fascination for programming and computer.
                  Since then, a lot of things have changed, but my passion for programming never does. 
                  I still see the terminal screen as a canvas for me to get creative and the keyboard is a brush to make extraordinary things, up to this day.
                  <br> <br>
                  After completing my high school degree in Hanoi, I moved to Montreal, Canada in 2017 to pursue a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Concordia University.
                  It was here that I learn the fundamentals of this field and get to do more of the things I love.
                  <br><br>
                  I love watching Netflix üçø , reading books üìï , travelling üöó , drinking boba ü•§ , and petting dogs üê∂.
                  <br><br>
                  I am always looking for a team where I can collaborate and deliver high-quality works. If I sound like a good fit for your team,
